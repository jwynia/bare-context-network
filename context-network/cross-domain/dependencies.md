# Cross-Component Dependencies

## Purpose
This document maps dependencies between different components and domains of the system, providing a comprehensive view of how different parts interact and rely on each other.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Architecture
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Evolving

### Dependency Overview

[Provide a high-level overview of the major dependencies in the system]

    A[Component A] -->|depends on| B[Component B]
    A -->|depends on| C[Component C]
    B -->|depends on| D[Component D]
    C -->|depends on| D
    E[Component E] -->|depends on| A
    E -->|depends on| F[Component F]
    F -->|depends on| D
```

### Critical Path Dependencies

[Identify and describe dependencies that are on the critical path for system functionality]

1. **[Dependency 1]**
   - **Source:** [Component/Domain]
   - **Target:** [Component/Domain]
   - **Nature:** [What is depended upon]
   - **Criticality:** [High/Medium/Low]
   - **Impact if Broken:** [Description of impact]
   - **Verification Method:** [How to verify this dependency is satisfied]

2. **[Dependency 2]**
   - **Source:** [Component/Domain]
   - **Target:** [Component/Domain]
   - **Nature:** [What is depended upon]
   - **Criticality:** [High/Medium/Low]
   - **Impact if Broken:** [Description of impact]
   - **Verification Method:** [How to verify this dependency is satisfied]
