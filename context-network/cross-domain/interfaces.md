# System Interfaces

## Purpose
This document defines the interfaces between different components and domains of the system, providing a comprehensive reference for how different parts of the system communicate and interact.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Architecture
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

### Interface Definitions

#### Interface 1: [Interface Name]

**Type:** [API/Event/Data/UI/etc.]
**Purpose:** [Brief description of what this interface is for]

**Provider:** [Component/Domain that provides this interface]
**Consumers:** [Components/Domains that consume this interface]

**Contract:**
```
[Format appropriate to the interface type, such as:
- API specification
- Event schema
- Data format
- UI component props
- etc.]
```

**Usage Examples:**
```
[Examples of how to use this interface]
```

**Error Handling:**
[Description of how errors are handled across this interface]

**Performance Characteristics:**
[Description of performance expectations, such as latency, throughput, etc.]

**Security Considerations:**
[Description of security aspects of this interface]

**Versioning Strategy:**
[Description of how this interface is versioned]

#### Interface 2: [Interface Name]

**Type:** [API/Event/Data/UI/etc.]
**Purpose:** [Brief description of what this interface is for]
