### Update Log

#### 5/16/2025: Context Network Generalization and Cleanup
- **Changes Made:**
  - Updated terminology throughout to be more universally applicable
  - Renamed `domains/` to `elements/` for broader applicability
  - Renamed `cross-domain/` to `connections/` for clearer meaning
  - Renamed `architecture.md` to `structure.md` to be less software-centric
  - Renamed process files to be more generic:
    - `development.md` → `creation.md`
    - `testing.md` → `validation.md`
    - `deployment.md` → `delivery.md`
  - Updated classification examples to include non-software domains
  - Updated element types to include examples for various project types
  - Modified relationship references to reflect new terminology
  - Removed redundant files and directories:
    - Deleted `foundation/architecture.md`
    - Deleted `domains/` directory and its contents
    - Deleted `cross-domain/` directory and its contents
    - Deleted `processes/development.md`
    - Deleted `processes/testing.md`
    - Deleted `processes/deployment.md`
  - Updated references in remaining files to point to new file paths
- **Affected Nodes:**
  - `.context-network.md`
  - `discovery.md`
  - `foundation/project_definition.md`
  - `foundation/structure.md` (new)
  - `foundation/principles.md`
  - `elements/README.md` (new)
  - `connections/dependencies.md` (new)
  - `connections/interfaces.md` (new)
  - `processes/creation.md` (new)
  - `processes/validation.md` (new)
  - `processes/delivery.md` (new)
  - `processes/document_integration.md`
- **Rationale:**
  - Make the base context network more adaptable to a wide range of project types
  - Remove software-specific terminology to support creative, research, and other project types
  - Create a more universal foundation for specialized templates to build upon
- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Consider creating specialized templates for specific project types
  - Review and update any remaining software-centric terminology
  - Test the generalized structure with different project types

#### 5/14/2025: Initial Context Network Setup
- **Changes Made:**
  - Created `.context-network.md` discovery file
  - Established standard context network directory structure
  - Created `discovery.md` navigation guide
  - Created `processes/document_integration.md` for inbox document processing
  - Created `meta/updates.md` (this file) for tracking changes
- **Affected Nodes:**
  - All initial structure nodes
- **Rationale:**
  - Initial setup of context network for the project
- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Create foundation documents
  - Set up templates for different document types
